      1. If the phone number belongs to a registered user:
        - Only the profile of that registered user is shown in the search results.
        - If the searching user exists in the contact list of the registered user, the registered user's email is also displayed.
      2. Else if the phone number is found in contact lists:
        - The search results will display all users who have saved the number in their contact list.
        - Each result shows the name as saved by different users, the phone number, and the spam likelihood.

   - Search by **name**:
     - Returns matches for names starting with or containing the given name query.

4. **Spam Reporting**:
   - Users can mark any phone number as spam.
   - Spam likelihood is calculated based on user actions.

5. **Security**:
   - Token-based authentication.
   - Secure password storage with Django‚Äôs `AbstractBaseUser`.

Note:
It is assumed that the user‚Äôs phone contacts will be automatically imported into the app‚Äôs global database. This functionality is not implemented as part of this project.
